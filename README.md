You were recently hired by the City of Chicago as a data analyst to support the Finance Department. For your first project on the job, the Head of Finance (who has minimal data experience) asked you to send a summary via email answering the following questions:

Does the City of Chicago pay more for salary or hourly employees among those who are full-time?
What's the distribution of pay, among City of Chicago employees, stratified by hourly and salary employees?
What are the top 5 highest paid departments by total and employee average?
